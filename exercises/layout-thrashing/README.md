Addressing layout thrashing typically involves reorganizing the way you read from and write to the DOM to prevent unnecessary layout recalculations.

One effective method is to batch all DOM reads together and then perform all the DOM writes. This approach minimizes the number of reflows.

Another approach is to use requestAnimationFrame to defer actions until the next repaint, reducing the frequency of layout recalculations.
